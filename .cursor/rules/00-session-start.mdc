# jbcom OSS Ecosystem - Agent Session Start

## 🚨 MANDATORY FIRST STEPS

You are operating in the **jbcom OSS Ecosystem** - a public monorepo for open source packages.

### Before Doing ANYTHING Else:

```bash
# 1. Check current context
cat memory-bank/activeContext.md

# 2. Check what issues are being tracked
gh issue list --label "agent-session" --state open

# 3. Check CI status
gh run list --limit 5

# 4. Check for stuck PRs
gh pr list --json number,title,mergeable
```

### DO NOT skip these steps. Previous agents have failed repeatedly by ignoring context.

## 🔑 Authentication

This is a **public** repo owned by `jbcom`. Use:

```bash
# All operations use GITHUB_JBCOM_TOKEN
GH_TOKEN="$GITHUB_JBCOM_TOKEN" gh pr list
GH_TOKEN="$GITHUB_JBCOM_TOKEN" gh issue create ...
```

## 📋 Tracking Requirements

**EVERY session must:**
1. Check for existing tracking issues before creating new ones
2. Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` before ending session
3. Create GitHub issues for problems discovered
4. Reference issue numbers in commits and PRs

## 🔗 Key Resources

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `memory-bank/activeContext.md` | Current state and focus |
| `memory-bank/progress.md` | Session history |
| GitHub Issues | Task tracking |
| `.ruler/AGENTS.md` | Code style guidelines |

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't assume secrets are configured correctly** - CHECK first
2. **Don't delete workflows** - they exist for a reason
3. **Don't chase individual bugs** - create issues and track systematically
4. **Don't ignore CI failures** - read the ACTUAL logs
5. **Don't skip the startup sequence** - that's why you're reading this
