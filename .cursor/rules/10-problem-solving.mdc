# Problem Solving Protocol

## When Something Fails

### Step 1: Diagnose (Don't Guess)

```bash
# Get the actual error
gh run view <run-id> --log | grep -A10 "error\|Error\|failed"

# Check if it's a known issue
gh issue list --search "<error message>"
```

### Step 2: Track

```bash
# Create or update a tracking issue
gh issue create --title "Bug: <description>" --body "..."
# OR
gh issue comment <number> --body "Update: ..."
```

### Step 3: Fix Systematically

1. Understand the root cause (not just symptoms)
2. Make ONE change at a time
3. Test locally if possible
4. Create a PR with clear description
5. Wait for CI before making more changes

### Step 4: Document

```bash
# Update memory bank
echo "## Session $(date)" >> memory-bank/progress.md
echo "- Fixed: <what>" >> memory-bank/progress.md
```

## Anti-Patterns (DO NOT DO THESE)

❌ Making random changes hoping something works
❌ Deleting things you don't understand
❌ Ignoring error messages
❌ Creating multiple PRs for the same issue
❌ Skipping CI checks with --admin without good reason
❌ Assuming you know what's wrong without reading logs
❌ Copying/moving files without reading them first
❌ Consolidating code without running the build after

## When Stuck

1. **Read the documentation** for the tool/action you're using
2. **Check GitHub issues** on the upstream repo
3. **Ask for help** by creating an issue explaining what you tried
4. **DO NOT keep trying random things**
