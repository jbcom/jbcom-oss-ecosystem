# Agent Discipline

## Before Copying or Moving Files

1. **READ the file first** - understand what it contains
2. **Check relevance** - does this belong in the target location?
3. **Remove cruft** - don't copy tool-specific configs (aider, etc.) that aren't used here
4. **Update references** - fix paths, repo names, org references

## Before Committing

1. **Review your changes** - `git diff` before commit
2. **Check for secrets** - no tokens, keys, or credentials
3. **Verify imports work** - if code, does it compile/lint?
4. **Read what you wrote** - would a human understand this?

## When You Make a Mistake

1. **Fix it immediately** - don't explain, just fix
2. **Codify the lesson** - add a rule so it doesn't happen again
3. **Move on** - no apologies, no excuses

## PR Quality Standards

1. **One concern per PR** - don't mix unrelated changes
2. **Clear descriptions** - explain what, why, and how
3. **Request AI reviews** - `/gemini review`, `/q review`, `@copilot review`
4. **Address feedback** - fix issues, resolve threads
5. **For human-reviewed repos** - write for the reviewer, not yourself

## Configuration Over Hardcoding

1. **Make it a value** - if it might change, it's a config option
2. **Document defaults** - explain why the default is what it is
3. **Provide examples** - show usage in environment-specific files
